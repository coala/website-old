# Get It Native!

### `sudo pip3 install coala-bears`

You can install coala without any bears, just the bare framework, with
`sudo pip3 install coala`.

If the installation doesn't work for you, check out [common errors documentation](https://docs.coala.io/en/latest/Users/Install.html#installation-errors).

### Alternative: Run it in Docker

You can run coala inside docker on your source code with just one command. If you want to run it natively in your virtualenv, scroll to "Get It Native" :)

`docker run -ti -v $(pwd):/app --workdir=/app coala/base coala --files="**/*.py" --bears=PEP8Bear --save`

There's a few caveats and you'll have to have a working docker setup for this to work but if you do this might be the simpler way of installation.

-------------------------

# Try It!

### `cd project && coala --files="**/*.py" --bears=PEP8Bear --save`

### Your configuration will be automatically saved to the `.coafile` in the current directory. Go to our [bear documentation](https://coala.io/languages) to see what bears are available. Bears can be installed as pip packages.

### You can generate a config file to start with using [coala-quickstart](https://github.com/coala/coala-quickstart/blob/master/README.rst).

-------------------------

# Commit It!

### `git add .coafile && git commit -m "Add coala configuration"`
