### What your developers have to know:

# Just Execute `coala`

### Right where your `.coafile` lies. For non interactive/continuous integration, use `coala --ci` binary.

And of course, coala works on **Linux**, **Windows** and **Mac**! Just make sure
to use **Python 3**.

You can also execute coala right from your editor. Check out
[our gedit](https://github.com/coala/coala-gedit),
[atom](https://github.com/coala/coala-atom),
[sublime](https://github.com/coala/coala-sublime)
and other plugins!

If you want to use coala to automatically review pull requests, consider using
[GitMate](http://gitmate.io/). Please mind that GitMate is a prototype.
